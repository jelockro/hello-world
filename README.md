# hello-world

Hello, 
I plan on committing my various programming projects here.  I am trying to complete the MIT OpencourseWare Computer Science course.  I am also working on a personalized wordpress theme for my dayjob as a chiropractor.  I have three kids, and so most of my work is done after 9:00 PM, which is not ideal.  I hope to continue my self-directed education and chronicle it here.
